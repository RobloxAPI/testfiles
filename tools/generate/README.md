# generate
Generates test files that would be tedious to write by hand.

## Usage

1. Install Go.
2. Open a shell to this directory.
3. Run `go build` to build or rebuild the program.
4. Run `generate -help` for usage.

Test files are located relative to the working directory, so `generate` should
only be run from this directory.
